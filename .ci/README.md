# ScienceDiscovery CI test image

This directory defines a source-free CI toolchain image and the repository
entry points for unit tests (UT), hermetic system tests (ST), and browser E2E.
Here the `e2e` layer is the mocked browser subset, not the definition of all
E2E: public API, CLI and local-stack user journeys also qualify when they use
the real product entry path and assert user outcomes. Their separate driver
commands are not automatically run by `pnpm ci:e2e`; see
[CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md#user-perspective-e2e). The existing layer
names and pipeline entry points are unchanged.

The image contains Node.js 22.19, pnpm 11.1.2, Python 3.12, uv, bubblewrap,
build tools, and Playwright's Chromium system libraries. Product source and
test dependencies are supplied only by the checkout mounted at `/src`.

## One plan, three layers

The three hermetic layers are three slices of one plan, not three suites. Each
runs `test/support/tagged/shared.mjs` against the single selector in
[test/support/tagged/profiles.mjs](../test/support/tagged/profiles.mjs),
narrowed only by the group that layer schedules:

| CI layer | Entry point | Slice of the shared selector |
|---|---|---|
| UT | `pnpm ci:ut` | `category:ut` |
| ST | `pnpm ci:st` | `category:st` |
| E2E | `pnpm ci:e2e` | `category:e2e`, driving `.ci/run-e2e.sh` for the stack lifecycle |

`category` is single-valued and required, so those three slices partition the
plan: together they are exactly `pnpm test:shared`, the command a developer
runs. Which cases are selected comes from the tags in each test's own source —
never from the machine, its credentials, its devices or its installed
services. A missing capability fails the plan's preflight, and a skip is a
failed run, so a layer cannot go green by running less.
[test/support/tagged/MIGRATION.md](../test/support/tagged/MIGRATION.md) records
what the plan covers and why live-model, NPU, legacy and macOS work is outside
it; those keep their own opt-in entry points (`ci:st:real`, `ci:e2e:real`,
`ci:st:npu`, `ci:e2e:legacy`).

`node .ci/tagged-summary.mjs` reads each slice's frozen plan back and fails
unless `planned == executed == passed` with nothing skipped — including when a
layer stopped before it produced a plan at all.

## Coverage reporting

Coverage is recorded by the run that gates, not by a second one. The `UT` job
runs `pnpm ci:ut -- --profile <profile> --coverage`: the same plan, the same
per-file Node workers and the same pytest invocation, with V8 coverage added to
each Node worker and `coverage run` put in front of pytest. `--coverage` changes
how the selected cases are measured and nothing about which cases are selected.
The job uploads what the run wrote, `<CI_RESULTS_DIR>/ut/tagged/coverage/`, as
the `ut-coverage` artifact, including when the run failed.

The `Coverage` job `needs` UT, downloads that artifact and runs
`node scripts/coverage-report.mjs` (`pnpm coverage:report`), which only reads
and merges files: it executes no test and starts no process. There is no second
selection either — pull requests, pushes and the nightly run all report on the
whole plan the gate ran, so there is no diff-based list of directories any
more. Release calls skip both the recording and the job.

What that buys is one answer to "why did this case not run": because the plan
did not select it. A `status:external` case — `services/memory-graph` has 77 of
them, all needing a live Neo4j — is absent from coverage for the same reason it
is absent from the gate, because it is the gate's run. `model:real`,
`npu:required` and another platform's cases are out for the same reason. ST and
the mocked browser E2E load no product module into a measured process, so they
contribute no module coverage and the summary says so rather than reporting a
number for them.

What the run writes is self-describing. Each Node test file leaves one lcov
whose records name that test file and a repository-relative source; each Python
project leaves one `coverage.py` JSON report with repository-relative paths;
`manifest.json` records the plan digest, the profile, the run's planned,
executed and passed counts, and how many files it owed coverage for. The report
credits a directory with what its own tests exercised — a record measuring
`packages/cas` from a test under `services/api` is that test's dependency, not
cas's coverage — merges records for one source file line by line, and leaves
built output (`dist/`) and installed dependencies out. Reproduce CI locally
with:

```bash
CI_RESULTS_DIR=$PWD/.ci-results CI_RUNTIME_DIR=$PWD/.ci-runtime \
  pnpm ci:ut -- --profile pr --coverage
pnpm coverage:report -- --input .ci-results/ut/tagged/coverage
```

If the UT job passed, every file it ran must have left coverage, and the report
step fails when one did not: that is a pipeline defect, not a partial result.
If the UT job failed, the report summarises whatever it uploaded, labels it
partial, and succeeds; nothing is re-run to fill the gap, and the UT job's own
failure stays the signal. Coverage percentages are informational — there is no
threshold.

CI uploads separate SHA-qualified Node.js and Python artifacts containing only
aggregate and per-group `summary.json` files. The same job writes a
human-readable `Coverage summary` to the run page: the UT run's plan and
counts, then Node.js and Python separately with the measured file and group
counts and the line and branch totals, each row labelled by where its numbers
came from — the UT run, a partial upload from a failed UT run, or unavailable.

## Test tags and CI selection

`.ci/test-catalog.mjs` classifies every repository CI test family as a stable
case, for the CI scheduler and the merge-request result table. It is metadata
over the layer entry points above, not a second test suite and not the list of
cases a layer runs — that list is the plan. Cases inherit the environment
envelope of their layer; when one child needs a stricter capability, split it
into a separate case instead of weakening the tag. Each case has tags for all
required environment dimensions:

- `arch:amd64|arm64`
- `llm:none|stub|real|unreviewed`
- `npu:none|required|unreviewed`
- `sandbox:none|bubblewrap|seatbelt|host|unreviewed`
- `layer:ut|st|e2e`, `container:*`, and runtime `network:*`

No case carries `sandbox:seatbelt` today: the macOS Seatbelt tests live in
`services/runner/src/macos-seatbelt.test.ts` and carry `os:macos`, so the
Linux/amd64 target this repository's CI plans against never selects them. They
no longer skip themselves off macOS — a Linux run simply does not contain them,
and a macOS plan would.

List the vocabulary or cases without executing tests:

```bash
pnpm ci:tags
pnpm ci:tags -- --json
pnpm ci:list
pnpm ci:list -- --tag layer:e2e --tag llm:stub --tag arch:amd64
pnpm ci:list -- --tag llm:none,llm:stub --exclude npu:required
pnpm ci:list -- --tag arch:arm64 --json
```

Repeated `--tag` clauses are AND conditions. Commas inside one clause are OR,
and every `--exclude` removes a match. `--case <id>` selects exact case IDs and
can be combined with tags. JSON output is intended for CI matrix generation.

Run the selected existing entry points with the same filters:

```bash
pnpm ci:run -- --tag layer:st --tag llm:stub --tag arch:amd64
pnpm ci:run -- --case e2e.mocked
```

`ci:run` requires at least one positive `--tag` or `--case`, verifies the
native architecture, and preflights every selected case before starting any
of them. Live cases additionally require `CI_ALLOW_REAL=1` and their documented
credential variables. Legacy E2E requires `CI_ALLOW_LEGACY=1`. The NPU smoke
requires `CI_ALLOW_NPU=1` and an explicit `SCIENCE_AGENT_NPU_PYTHON` from the
dedicated NPU environment; it fails closed in this generic image. Its catalog
entry explains the host requirement.

## The sandbox capability

UT is one layer. A test that drives a real bubblewrap sandbox says so with
`sandbox:bubblewrap`, and that is the whole mechanism: the plan turns the tag
into a preflight, and a host that cannot create the user namespaces bubblewrap
needs fails the entire run rather than quietly running the rest.

```bash
bwrap --ro-bind / / --dev /dev true && echo sandbox ok
```

On Ubuntu 24.04 a failure here is usually the AppArmor restriction on
unprivileged user namespaces, which every job that needs the sandbox clears
with `sudo sysctl --write kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0`.

When adding a UT test, put it in the package or suite that already matches its
requirements, and never weaken an isolation assertion so a test can run without
the sandbox; see [.agents/skills/ci/SKILL.md](../.agents/skills/ci/SKILL.md).

`pnpm ci:catalog:check` is the guard. It fails when a scheduler case has an
unknown tag or the wrong number of values for a dimension, when a workspace
package's test file sits outside the shared runner's collection patterns and so
would be run by no layer at all, when a package has a test script but no test
file, when a layer runs something that is not a slice of the shared plan, or
when an entry point drifts off that slice. `pnpm ci:selftest` runs the
regression tests for that guard, and the UT layer runs it.

## Build

Build the current host architecture. Using `.ci` as the build context makes it
impossible for the Dockerfile to copy the product checkout into a layer.

```bash
docker build --file .ci/Dockerfile --tag sciencediscovery-ci:test .ci
```

Build both supported Linux architectures and publish a manifest:

```bash
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  --file .ci/Dockerfile \
  --tag <registry>/sciencediscovery-ci:<tag> \
  --push \
  .ci
```

For a local, non-pushed multi-architecture artifact, replace `--push` with
`--output type=oci,dest=sciencediscovery-ci.oci`. Docker cannot `--load` a
multi-platform manifest into its classic local image store.

## Source and result mounts

The repository has no submodules, so a plain checkout is enough. Mount a real
checkout rather than a linked Git worktree: a worktree's `.git` file points at
the main repository and is not portable into the container.

All commands use the same mounts. `<host-results>` should be a new or empty
directory for the run, and it must already exist and be owned by the invoking
identity: Docker creates a missing bind-mount source as root, and the container
then cannot write its reports.

Mount the checkout at `/src`, which is also the image's `WORKDIR`. Do not mount
it at `/workspace`: the Runner's bubblewrap sandbox mounts the Session
workspace over that exact path, so a checkout there is shadowed inside the
sandbox. Five Runner tests fail that way — the two `scientific-execution`
subcases lose their fake managed interpreter and exit 127, and the three NPU
Broker cases see their `/workspace`-prefixed arguments re-anchored into
doubled paths.

```text
-v <repo>:/src
-v <host-results>:/ci-results
```

The container installs into the mounted checkout, so `node_modules` ends up
bound to the container's pnpm store. The next host command then aborts with
`ERR_PNPM_ABORTED_REMOVE_MODULES_DIR_NO_TTY`, because pnpm wants to purge the
modules directory and refuses to do so without a TTY. Rebind it with
`CI=1 pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` before working on the host again, or give
the container a checkout of its own.

Run with the checkout owner's numeric identity so generated dependencies,
build output, and reports remain writable on the host and permission-sensitive
tests do not acquire root's bypass privileges:

```text
--user "$(id -u):$(id -g)"
```

The image also defaults to its unprivileged `node` user (UID/GID 1000), but the
explicit flag is portable to Linux agents whose checkout owner uses another
numeric identity.

Runner tests and mocked journeys execute bubblewrap inside Docker. Use the same
non-privileged sandbox allowances as the product's checked-in Compose file:

```text
--security-opt seccomp=unconfined
--security-opt apparmor=unconfined
--security-opt systempaths=unconfined
```

Do not add `--privileged` or mount the Docker socket. A host that denies
unprivileged user namespaces still blocks the real sandbox; see
[Known limits](#known-limits).

Optional cache volumes speed up repeated dependency and browser installs:

```text
--mount type=volume,source=sciencediscovery-ci-cache,target=/ci-cache
```

That volume is not only a cache: CI points `CI_RUNTIME_DIR` below it, so it also
holds the E2E stack's `data/envs`. (Without that variable — a laptop run — the
E2E layer falls back to the repository-local, gitignored `.e2e-data/` instead of
the data directory a personal instance uses.) Those service environments are *editable*
installs whose `.pth` files record the absolute source path, so a volume
populated from one checkout location is unusable from another. After changing
the mount path, drop `/ci-cache/sciencediscovery-e2e` and
`/ci-cache/sciencediscovery-tests` (or the whole volume); otherwise the stack
starts and the service dies with `ModuleNotFoundError`, and the E2E layer
reports BLOCKED because it never became healthy.

## One command per layer

From the repository root, substitute absolute host paths for `<repo>` and
`<host-results>`.

UT:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
  --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
  --security-opt systempaths=unconfined \
  -v <repo>:/src \
  -v <host-results>:/ci-results \
  sciencediscovery-ci:test pnpm ci:ut
```

ST:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
  --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
  --security-opt systempaths=unconfined \
  -v <repo>:/src \
  -v <host-results>:/ci-results \
  sciencediscovery-ci:test pnpm ci:st
```

E2E (mocked only):

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  --env E2E_COMMIT_SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
  --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
  --security-opt systempaths=unconfined \
  -v <repo>:/src \
  -v <host-results>:/ci-results \
  sciencediscovery-ci:test pnpm ci:e2e
```

The selector can replace the final command on capability-driven workers. For
example, this runs only hermetic ST cases compatible with amd64 and no NPU:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -v <repo>:/src \
  -v <host-results>:/ci-results \
  sciencediscovery-ci:test \
  pnpm ci:run -- --tag layer:st --tag llm:stub --tag arch:amd64 --exclude npu:required
```

Set `CI_RESULTS_DIR` only when the result mount uses a different in-container
path. The default E2E invocation chooses internal loopback ports, generates an ephemeral
local API token, builds and starts its own stack, installs the pinned Chromium,
and always stops the stack while collecting reports. It never reads
`E2E_LLM_*` and cannot select the `real` Playwright project.

`E2E_COMMIT_SHA` gives journey reports an immutable revision even when the
mounted checkout is a linked worktree whose external Git metadata is not
visible in the container. A regular clone can still resolve its own SHA, but
passing the value explicitly keeps the command identical across both layouts.

The first E2E run downloads the Chromium revision pinned by
`test/e2e.package-lock.json`. The entry never invokes managed-environment
setup and defaults `SCIENTIFIC_ENVS=0`, so the mocked job does not access conda
channels. J3 therefore reports its managed-Python precondition as BLOCKED,
never as a pass. A separate, explicitly network-enabled job may set
`E2E_SCIENTIFIC_ENVS=1` and reuse a pre-seeded `CI_RUNTIME_DIR`; that setup is
outside the generic default command.

## Results

The host directory mounted at `/ci-results` receives:

```text
ut/
  run.log                          # the layer entry point's own log
  summary.json                     # the layer's exit code and per-step timings
  tagged/                          # the frozen plan and its accounting
    plan.json
    preflight.json
    summary.json                   # planned / executed / passed / failed / skipped
st/
  run.log
  summary.json
  tagged/
e2e/
  run.log
  stack.log
  summary.txt
  playwright-report/
  test-results/                  # results.json, failure screenshots/traces
  journey-reports/               # report.md/html and step screenshots
selection/
  run.log                         # selected case commands and combined output
  summary.json                    # selection, tags, result paths and outcomes
```

`run-layer.mjs` stops at the first failing UT/ST command and records every
attempted command, exit code, and duration. It gives each run a unique
`SCIENCE_AGENT_DATA_DIR` below `CI_RUNTIME_DIR` (default
`/ci-cache/sciencediscovery-tests`) and removes it afterward, so tests cannot
leave generated logs or bootstrap tokens in the source mount. The E2E entry propagates
Playwright's exit code after copying reports, including failure evidence.

The default mocked suite passes today: 8 passed and 2 skipped against an
isolated local stack. Both skips are preconditions, not coverage — J3 is
BLOCKED because the generic command keeps `SCIENTIFIC_ENVS=0`, and the
connector case is skipped for the same class of reason. Playwright exits 0 on
a skip, so a job that only reads the exit code reports a blocked journey as a
pass; read the counts and the not-passed titles as well.

The earlier note here claimed J4 must stay red because only the main
artifact reached the Project catalog. That is no longer the failure: J4 was
red because it still drove the SubAgent card as an inline disclosure, which
`fix(web): open SubAgent runs in a dedicated view` replaced, and it never
reached the artifact assertions. With the journey following the card into its
own conversation, both declared artifacts do appear.

## Known limits

The default image is intentionally hermetic with respect to models and external
services. The following checks need capabilities that a generic repository CI
container cannot safely or reliably provide.

| Test or capability | Missing generic-container capability | Recommended execution |
|---|---|---|
| `test/api/run_real_smoke.sh` | Live model endpoint, credential, outbound network, billable/rate-limited calls | Separate secret-bearing job with `CI_ALLOW_REAL=1` and `SCIENCE_AGENT_LLM_BASE_URL`, `SCIENCE_AGENT_LLM_MODEL`, `SCIENCE_AGENT_LLM_API_TOKEN`; select `st.agent-loop-real` |
| `npm --prefix .e2e run test:real` and `journey-real-request.spec.ts` | Live OpenAI-compatible endpoint and `E2E_LLM_*`; the real project is deliberately absent by default | Dedicated job with `CI_ALLOW_REAL=1` and the three `E2E_LLM_*` variables; select `e2e.real`, never add it to `pnpm ci:e2e` |
| Real NPU workloads such as `services/runner/workloads/npu-smoke-test.py` | Vendor device nodes, drivers, runtime libraries, model/data assets, and usually a native aarch64/NPU host | Hardware-specific runner with explicit device mounts and its own acceptance record |
| Full bubblewrap execution when the host denies unprivileged user namespaces | Docker flags cannot override a host kernel/AppArmor policy that rejects user namespace creation | Run on a Linux worker with user namespaces enabled; record UT/E2E as BLOCKED if the bwrap preflight fails |
| Host-only sandbox fallback/full-profile validation | A container cannot reproduce every host `/proc/sys`, AppArmor, LXC, and distribution-specific bwrap combination | Keep the existing stubbed capability/unit tests in UT; run real preflight/fallback checks on representative native hosts |
| Docker Desktop on macOS/Windows | The product runner requires Linux user/mount namespaces and bubblewrap | Use a native Linux CI worker or VM |

The tag catalog keeps unsupported generic-container capabilities discoverable
instead of silently dropping them. For example,
`pnpm ci:list -- --tag npu:required` lists `st.npu-smoke` with its limitation.
On a dedicated amd64 or arm64 NPU environment, set `CI_ALLOW_NPU=1` and point
`SCIENCE_AGENT_NPU_PYTHON` at the MindSpore-enabled interpreter before running
that selection. The generic image has neither dependency and remains blocked.

The hermetic `test/api/run_m1_smoke.sh` is supported and is the ST entry. A
missing historical/example command such as `test/gateway/run_m0_smoke.sh` is
not classified as unsupported; it simply is not part of this revision.
